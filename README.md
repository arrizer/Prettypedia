# PrettyPedia

*A Wikipedia that does not hurt the eyes*

Wikipedia is cool and most of us use it every day. But it's web-design is not very pretty and makes it hard to read and enjoy longer articles. That's why I built a neat little Safari Extension, that enhances Wikipedias default style, remove a lot of the clutter from the page and optimises the page for best readability.

## Screenshots

![foo](https://github.com/arrizer/Prettypedia/raw/master/PrettyPedia.safariextz)

## Install

Open this page in Safari and __[click here](https://raw.github.com/arrizer/Prettypedia/master/Screenshots/page.png)__

Or get a Safari Developer Certificate und use the Extension Builder to load the __PrettyPedia.safariextension__.

## Todo

Some features from the original design are still missing:

- Language selection (view article in different language)
- Article Metadata (location, etc.)
- Edit area

Also planned but not yet implemented:

- Clicking an image will display it inline in a fullscreen lightbox rather than opening a Wikimedia file page
- Better looking navboxes
